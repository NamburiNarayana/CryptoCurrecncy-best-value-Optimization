We will use the divide and conquer paradigm to solve the maximization problem. The divide and conquer method recursively breaks down the problem into smaller sub-problems until they can be solved directly. The solutions to these sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the divide and conquer paradigm.
we are using gui platform pyqt5 to make our algorithm user friendly. we take the inputs as dates from the user and get the data of prices of cryptocurrency using web scrapping 
Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.
now with the data obtained from web we process the above mentioned algorithm to get maximum profit from the prices of the cryptocurrency
